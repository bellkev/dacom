The Clojure community is all about libraries that do one thing and do it well, and justifiably so.
However, it can be especially useful for newcomers to the community to see a more "horizontal" cross-section
of what's out there. To that end, I have thrown together what I see as some of the most exciting pieces of the
Clojure(Script) ecosystem into one skeleton rich-client web app. I still have plenty to learn about the world
of Clojure, so I welcome feedback and contributions from all.

Of course, this is just one possible combination of technologies and is definitely not a one-size-fits-all stack.
However, any feedback on how to better embody Clojure(Script)/Datomic/Compojure/Om/Leiningen "best practices" are
especially welcome.
